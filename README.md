## Primer

An attempt to analyze any given integer (no matter its size) into prime factors.

## Motivation

My passion concerning mathematics and prime numbers (Riemann hypothesis and cryptography).

## Build status

Under heavy construction, adding fixes and features every day. As well as bugs lol.

## Code style

Standard style, using exclusively VS Code.

## Known bugs

- Copy to clipboard does not work under Ubuntu
  > The problem happens because Xorg takes a conservative approach to copying. It copies only a reference to the original data when the user performs a select or copy. It doesn't go and retrieve the actual data from the source program until the user requests a paste. It saves a lot of unneeded transfer of data this way, at the expense of having no way of retrieving data from a closed program that hasn't saved its clipboard somewhere else.
